xpl-zibase
==========

xpl-zibase is a Zodianet ZiBase gateway for the xPL home automation protocol.

It allows to :
  - Receive RF messages from the ZiBase (many supported protocols : X10,
  Chacon, X2D...)
  - Send RF commands to devices configured in the ZiBase

This work is heavily using and based on the great xpl-perl suite
by Mark Hindess : http://www.xpl-perl.org.uk/.

(because of UDP broadcast use).
