=head1 NAME

xpl-zibase - Perl script for an xPL Zodianet's ZiBase gateway

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  xpl-zibase [flags] [options] <device>
  where valid flags are:
    --help                        - show this help text
    --verbose                     - verbose mode (for the xPL layer)
    --zibase-verbose              - verbose mode (for the ZiBase layer)
  and valid options are (default shown in brackets):
    --interface if0               - the interface for xPL messages (first
                                   non-loopback or loopback)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an xPL client that interfaces with the Zodianet's ZiBase
home automation controller.

It heavily uses and is based on the xpl-perl suite by Mark Hindess.

To use this application, you have to own a ZiBase home automation controller
(see http://www.zodianet.com).
The ZiBase has to be configured/working, and has to be on the same subnet as
the server running this xpl-zibase client (because of UDP broadcast use).

=head1 RF RECEIVING

The xpl-zibase client will broadcast xPL Messages as soon as the ZiBase
receives a RF command from any supported home automation device (Oregon
Scientific sensors, Homeeasy remote, x10 switch, etc...).

Sensors values will generate sensor.basic messages. Examples :
  * - thgr228n.OS439171073[temp]=16.2
  * - thgr228n.OS439171073[humidity]=67

Home automation remotes button press will generate sensor.basic messages
using the 'input' device type. As defined in the sensor.basic schema, High
means 'on' and Low means 'off'.
Examples :
  * - CS182610306[input]=high
  * - CS182930487[input]=low

Finally, pure basic X10 RF commands received will generate x10.basic trigger
xPL messages. Examples :
  * - e14 on
  * - e14 off

=head1 RF SENDING

You can use this client to send RF commands via the ZiBase using CMND xPL
message conforming to the x10.basic schema.
Indeed, all configured actuators in the ZiBase are given a pseudo X10-like
identifier (even if they use another protocol sucj as Chacon or X2D) such
as A4 or P10.

Example :
To turn on a device that has the F5 x10 pseudo identifier, juste send the
following xPL message :
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c rfcmd.basic device=f5 command=on protocol=x10
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c x10.basic device=f5 command=on 
  
To turn on a device that has the A10 zwave pseudo identifier, juste send the
following xPL message :
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c rfcmd.basic device=a10 command=on protocol=zwave
  
The client also support dimming levels (only for Chacon and X2D devices) :
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c x10.basic device=f5 command=dim level=50 
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c rfcmd.basic device=f5 command=dim protocol=x10 level=50
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c rfcmd.basic device=a10 command=dim protocol=zwave level=50
  
To execute the scenario number 15:
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c scencmd.basic scenario=15
   
To launch a script:   
  xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c script.basic script="cmd:lm 1 aft 60"

  "cmd:lm [toto]" launch scenario label as toto
  "cmd:lm 2 aft 3600" launch scenario 2 after 3600 seconds
  "cmd:lm [toto].lm [tata]" launch scenario label as toto and after launch scenario label as tata
  Don't forgot double quote
  label of a scenario with space doesn't work you to use an underscore instead of space caractere
